  ## Description
  In this application, the goal was to produce a content management system that allows a non-developer to interact with it in order to manipulate a MYSQL database.  Applications such as these enable companies to complete technical tasks with employees that do not posess highly technical skills; which, in turn, enables them to lower their cost of labor as they can accomplish database manipulation with lower level employees.
